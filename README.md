Marianne Johnson

Hello! My name is Marianne Johnson. I'm from Arizona and this is my 4th semester at BYU-I (although it's my third semester on campus). I like to write, draw, and play video games. There isn't really much interesting about me to tell. I look forward to working with all of you!

Stephen Sanders

Hey, I'm Stephen. I live in Illinois, and hoping this semester goes well for me. I don't have much interesting with me either, my interests are drawing and video games, kinda like Marianne. Once we have github figured out, things ought to go more smoothly.
