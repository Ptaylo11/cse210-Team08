Marianne Johnson

Hello! My name is Marianne Johnson. I'm from Arizona and this is my 4th semester at BYU-I (although it's my third semester on campus). I like to write, draw, and play video games. There isn't really much interesting about me to tell. I look forward to working with all of you!

Stephen Sanders

Hey, I'm Stephen. I live in Illinois, and hoping this semester goes well for me. I don't have much interesting with me either, my interests are drawing and video games, kinda like Marianne. Once we have github figured out, things ought to go more smoothly.

Payton Taylor

Hello, I am Payton. I am from Idaho Falls and something interesting about me is that I have been racing dirt bikes since I was 4 years old. I enjoy video games and being outdoors. I look forward to working with you guys!!
